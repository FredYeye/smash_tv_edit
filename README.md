# Smash TV editor

This is an editor for *Super Smash T.V.* (SNES).

This project is still in development, so expect some features to be missing or not working properly.

## How to use
Download the program from the [releases](https://github.com/FredYeye/smash_tv_edit/releases) page.

Run the program and drag n' drop a valid Smash TV rom into the program window (only the US version is supported at the moment).

You can now view and edit the game's arenas! To save the changes, press the *Save changes* button at the bottom.
